# Tradovate API Overview
Overall API conventions are described in the [API conventions doc](Conventions.md).
Remote access to the API is discussed in the [access doc](Access.md).

# API changes
We expect the Tradovate API to change and grow. However, we intend to not break compatibility with existing clients, for an extended period of time. In general, new API resources and new resource fields can be expected to be added frequently. Elimination of resources or fields will require following a deprecation process. The precise deprecation policy for eliminating features is TBD.
What constitutes a compatible change and how to change the API are detailed by the [API change document](Changelog.md).

# API Swagger definitions
Complete API details are documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io). The Tradovate server exposes an API that can be used to retrieve the Swagger Tradovate API spec, by default it located at https://swagger.tradovate.com/v1/services.swagger.yaml, and a UI to browse the API documentation at https://swagger.tradovate.com. You can use Swagger UI as a playground to call API endpoints right in place.  

Swagger provides a wide range of client code generators. [C# reference implementation](csharp/services-api)
was generated by one of them. Feel free to explore other programming languages in http://editor.swagger.io

# API versioning
To make it easier to eliminate fields or restructure resource representations, Tradovate supports multiple API versions, each at a different API path, such as https://live-api.tradovate.com/v1

We chose to version both at the API level and at the resource or field level. API level is intended to ensure long-term consistency of protocol and entity relationship without breaking existing clients. Non-breaking changes and extensions can be done on resource and field level.
